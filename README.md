### What's this?

### Difference between (Freeze) & (localPlayer)
Freeze simply means the Cheat freezes the value (writing it to memory every ~200ms) and it only affects you.
<br>localPlayer on the other hand means the Cheat affects all localPlayers (CPU Controlled Bots and You) which may not be desirable.

As a general rule of thumb it's better to use Cheats that have (Freeze) at the end, over ones that have (localPlayer) at the end.

### Usage
1. Right click the .ct file to open it in Cheat Engine
2. Select the AssaultCube Process
3. Hack Away!

### How to use the Cheats?
